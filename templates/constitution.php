        <h2 class="chapter-title">CHAPTER 1: Preamble</h2>
        <div class="subsection">
            <p class="numbered">1.1 Definition of a Local Church</p>
            <p>A local church is an Assembly of God’s people who have joined themselves together in full purpose of heart under Christ, submitting themselves unquestionably to Him in His Word.</p>
            <p class="numbered">1.2 Purpose of a Local Church</p>
            <p>The sole purpose of our existence is to glorify God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This is done by pursuing the following objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.2.1 The united worship of the Almighty living God.</li>
                <li>1.2.2 The edification of all the members through preaching and teaching the whole counsel of God as revealed in the Bible.</li>
                <li>1.2.3 The proclamation of the Gospel for the salvation of sinners and their incorporation into the church.</li>
                <li>1.2.4 Fellowship through songs, prayers, the Word of God, sharing and giving of material things and the Lords Table, amongst the members of the church.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="numbered">1.3 Confession of Faith</p>
            <p>We take the whole Bible, the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments, as our confession of faith. Although we accept no man-made confession as finally authoritative, we agree with any revelation that is founded on the written Word of God. Below is a summary of what we believe the Bible teaches to instruct and guide our members and to preserve us against false doctrine.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1.3.1 Scripture</b> – The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are equally and in every part the Word of God, without any error, a sufficient and final revelation of all saving knowledge, faith and obedience. They must be received as the final authority in all matters of faith and practice. No other writings are accepted as Word of God or as having any such authority.</li>
                <li><b>1.3.2 God</b> – There is only one eternal God, who is Spirit... (truncated for brevity)</li>

        <div class="subsection">
            <p class="numbered">2.1 Definition of the Church</p>
            <p>The Church is the Body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with divine appointments for the fulfillment of her great commission. Each believer, born of the Spirit, is an integral part of the General Assembly and Church of the Firstborn, which are written in heaven.</p>
            <p class="numbered">2.2 The Local Church</p>
            <p>A local church is a company of believers in Jesus Christ, who have been baptized in water, and who assemble together for worship, prayer, teaching, fellowship, and service. The local church is the visible expression of the Body of Christ on earth.</p>
            <p class="numbered">2.3 The Purpose of the Local Church</p>
            <p>The purpose of the local church is to glorify God by making disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that Jesus has commanded.</p>

        <div class="subsection ms-3">
            <ul>
                <li>3.1 The Lord Jesus Christ is the only head of the church (Col. 1:18), governing it by the Word of God. This government is exercised in particular local churches through elders who apply the Word of God in their teaching and ruling. Christ Ekklesia Fellowship Chapel is thus independent, being directly under the rule of Christ. Therefore, this church shall not enter into any denomination, association, or union which involves the loss of this independence.</li>
                <li>3.2 Scripture recognizes two kinds of officers in the church: Elders (also called bishops or pastors) and deacons (Phil. 1:1).</li>
                <li>3.3 In normal circumstances, the church should be governed by a plurality of elders led by the Lead Pastor (Acts 14:23).</li>
                <li>3.4 There is no fixed number of elders or deacons, but men should be appointed to these offices as they are called and gifted by Christ through the recommendation of their regional pastors, then approved by the regional pastors/Bishops on behalf of the Overall lead Pastor/Bishop.</li>
                <li>3.5 They will remain in office indefinitely until such a time as they no longer fulfill the duties of their respective offices. No man may be appointed to either office unless he subscribes fully to this constitution.</li>
                <li>3.6 The Overall Lead Pastor/Bishop will provide spiritual, administrative and conciliative leadership to the entire church and its branches through his/her elders.</li>
                <li>3.7 Regional lead pastors/Bishops shall be appointed by the Overall Lead Pastor/Bishop to oversee regional branches under Christ Ekklesia Fellowship Chapel.</li>

        <div class="subsection ms-3">
            <p>The office of the elder has alone been appointed by Christ. Such elders are given spiritual authority to oversee the local church in accordance with Christ’s Word. Governance shall be administered by the elders assisted by the deacons.</p>

                <li>4.1.5 The church treasurer and secretary shall be appointed by the elders from amongst the diaconate.</li>
                <li>4.1.6 The Overall Lead Pastor is the main authority and the arms act on his behalf. He will head and appoint elders and deacons at the headquarters into these three arms. For the branches, the resident pastors will head and appoint elders and deacons into these functions appropriately, in their local churches.</li>
                <li>4.1.7 All the three arms will have a chairperson who will be an elder and a secretary who can be an elder or a deacon during any of their meetings, and minutes documented appropriately.</li>
                <li>4.1.8 With the recommendation of the pastor, any member of the church may be allowed to sit in any of the meetings of the three arms. For example, when a witness is necessary or when expert advice is required.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>4.3.1 The Nomination of an elder shall be by the unanimous recommendation of the existing elders, if they see that his gifts are already evident in the congregation. No man shall be nominated without his prior consent and such consent should arise out of a personal conviction of the Lord’s calling him to be an elder.</li>
                <li>4.3.2 The appointment of the elder shall then be publicly confirmed with the laying on of hands of the elders and the prayer of the whole church (1 Tim 4:14).</li>

For such reasons he may be released without prejudice.</li>

        <div class="subsection ms-3">
            <p class="fw-bold">5.1 Purpose:</p>
            <p>In the New Testament, decisions affecting the life of the church were generally taken when the whole church met together (1 Cor. 5:4), the main purposes being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5.1.1 To obtain the approval of the church for measures recommended by the elders and deacons.</li>
                <li>5.1.2 To inform the members about matters which cannot be made known at public meetings.</li>
                <li>5.1.3 Particular items such as finance and expenditure, the exercise of discipline and election of officers (chairperson and secretary), alteration to the constitution, reports on the spiritual condition and life of the church, sending out workers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="fw-bold">5.2 Types:</p>
            <p>There shall be three types of congregational meeting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5.2.1 The regular church business meeting, which shall be held at least three times a year.</li>
                <li>5.2.2 The annual general meeting, to meet as soon as possible after the audited accounts for the previous financial year have been received. The specific purpose of this meeting will be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>5.2.2.1 To review and report on all church activities in order to discuss them.</li>
                        <li>5.2.2.2 To present the financial statement for the previous year.</li>
                        <li>5.2.2.3 To discuss and approve the proposed budget for the coming year.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>5.2.3 Extraordinary church meetings may be called by the elders, or by a letter to the elders signed by at least one-third of the membership, which also states the specific purpose(s) of the proposed meeting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="fw-bold">5.3 Conduct</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5.3.1 Every congregational business meeting should be announced at least two Lord’s Days before the date on which it is held. In case of an emergency extraordinary church meeting every member of the leadership must be notified, preferably in writing or electronically. If these requirements are not met, no resolution passed is valid.</li>
                <li>5.3.2 For the transaction of business two-thirds of the resident membership at the time of the meeting, must be present to form a quorum. However, in the event of a lack of quorum at a properly called meeting, a second meeting for that agenda may be called and, if that second meeting is publicly announced in two consecutive Sunday morning services, then all those attending that second meeting shall form the quorum.</li>
                <li>5.3.3 At least 75% approval by the members present and eligible to vote is required to pass a recommendation (except in the case of dismissal of an official). Attendance at all official church meetings is obligatory. Non-resident members may attend but are not eligible to vote. If a member is unable to attend he must send a letter of apology. In all matters unanimity of the body of Christ is sought for.</li>
                <li>5.3.4 One of the elders shall preside over every church meeting. Each meeting shall begin with prayer and the reading of the minutes of the previous meetings, and shall end with prayer. Nothing shall be brought before the church meeting except through the elders, and in writing. Sufficient opportunity shall be given for discussion of all matters. The Secretary shall record minutes of each church meeting.</li>
                <li>5.3.5 Matters discussed at the meetings of the church are confidential. Therefore members are permitted to speak of these matters only to fellow-members.</li>

                <li>6.2 All branches and branch pastors are expected and encouraged to plant churches where there is a need.</li>
                <li>6.3 Any branch of Christ Ekklesia Fellowship Chapel that intends to open a branch should make a written application to the headquarters addressed to the Overall Lead Pastor/Bishop and should get a written permission, signed by the Overall lead pastor/Bishop and bearing an official stamp and seal, before opening a branch. The branch pastors should give an oversight leadership to the branches that they will open.</li>
                <li>6.4 All branches will have an obligation to tithe (10% of all their collections) to the headquarters through their immediate pastoral oversight.</li>
                <li>6.5 To attain this end, qualified elders and deacons should be prayed for and then commissioned to plant new churches in other needy areas. Such an elder/deacon will remain under the oversight of Christ Ekklesia Fellowship Chapel and its branches appropriately. All necessary support should be given to attain this end and every asset given or acquired thereafter will remain a property of Christ Ekklesia Fellowship Chapel.</li>
                <li>6.6 If there comes a request from an individual or already existing group to be covered by our registration, the elders shall first investigate it, and if it is considered worthy, shall make recommendation to the Church for approval. All assets acquired will not be required to belong to Christ Ekklesia Fellowship Chapel in this case. Such covering may be revoked at the discretion of Christ Ekklesia Fellowship Chapel at the headquarters.</li>
                <li>6.7 Branches will be autonomous in their governance but guided by the structure outlined in this constitution.</li>
