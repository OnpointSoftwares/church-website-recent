                Welcome to Christ Ekklesia Fellowship Chapel (CEFC): A Place of Purpose, Family, and Growth
            </div>
            <p>Greetings in the precious name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ! We are delighted to welcome you to Christ Ekklesia Fellowship Chapel (CEFC), a vibrant community of faith birthed by the divine leading of the Holy Spirit and anchored in the heart of Nakuru County, Kenya.</p>
            <p>Founded on <strong>February 19th, 2019</strong>, Christ Ekklesia emerged from a clear God-given vision entrusted to our founding pastors, <strong>David Kituyi and his wife, Rachael Kituyi</strong>. Responding faithfully to the call, they stepped out in obedience, establishing a spiritual home dedicated to worship, discipleship, and transformation. This journey of faith reached a significant milestone when the church was duly registered by the Registrar of Societies in the Republic of Kenya on <strong>April 9th, 2025</strong> (Reg. No. 32402), solidifying our presence and commitment within the nation.</p>
            <p>Our headquarters are located in the serene and welcoming area of <strong>Kabarak, Nakuru</strong>. From this central point, we extend our arms wide to embrace all seeking a deeper relationship with God and authentic Christian fellowship.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pastors David and Rachael Kituyi</strong> have faithfully led Christ Ekklesia since its inception. What began as a humble gathering of the immediate Kituyi family has blossomed, by the grace of God, into a thriving congregation of nearly 200 members as of 2025. This growth is a testament to God's faithfulness, the power of the Gospel, and the warm, family-oriented atmosphere we strive to cultivate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pastor David Kituyi</strong> brings a wealth of experience and passion to his calling. Beyond his pastoral heart, he is a prolific author with over ten impactful books to his name, sharing insights on faith, leadership, and personal development (<a href="https://www.dkituyiacademy.org" target="_blank">www.dkituyiacademy.org</a>). He is also an entrepreneur (<a href="https://www.ransemstudio.org" target="_blank">www.ransemstudio.org</a>), a dedicated mentor, and, alongside Pastor Rachael, a devoted family man. Together, they are blessed with three wonderful biological children: Kimberly, Kayla, and Nathanael. Their lives exemplify the integration of faith, family, and service.</p>
